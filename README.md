# Soil-Types-Classification
A CNN Model That Can Detect Soil Types 
### For Developing a Soil Types Classification, We Will use:
* Convolutional Neural Network: is a class of deep neural networks, most applied to analysing visual imagery. its widely used in applications of image and video recognition.
### To Build CNN we will use some popularly used open-source libraries:
* Keras : a high-level API to build and train deep learning models Runs on top of TensorFlow models. Because to preform computations and math operations.
* Tensorflow : is the most used open-source library to develop models in deep learning. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training of deep neural networks.
## Dataset 
For The Soil Type Detection, we used a publicly available Dataset “Soil types Dataset.”
This Dataset Contains images of Soil Types collected under different environment Conditions, Pictures of plants Leaves are divided into the following:
* Black Soil. 
* Cinder Soil. 
* Peat Soil. 
* Laterite Soil. 
*  Yellow Soil.
